[output]

# Ouput method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses' or 'raw'. 
# 'noncurses' is for systems that does not suport ncurses.
# 'raw' is a 16 bit data stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires a
# terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.

[smoothing]

# Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable.

# Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
